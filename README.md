# pd-filtercoeff
Filter coefficient generator for Pure Data Vanilla biquad filter.

The concept is converted from Nigel Redmon script "Biquad calculator v3"
https://www.earlevel.com/main/2021/09/02/biquad-calculator-v3/

The coefficient generator works very similar to what is avaiable on Max/MSP. Exept it takes dB gain instead of linear.
